# verbatim (phase-1-project)

# 👀 Problem

> I have found that most dictionary applications available today are quite busy, and a bit confusing. I feel that an overcomplicated application can cause the user to fatigue or delay them in solving their problem at hand.

# 💭 Proposal

> I plan to implement a very minimalistic approach to building a dictionary application. I want to keep the aesthetic clean and easy to use.  By keeping the application as minimal as possible, I feel this will allow the user to quickly find the definition to the word that they need, thereby encouraging them to use “verbatim” as their primary resource.
